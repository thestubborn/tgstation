  - qol: "Chisels used on carving blocks that were interrupted will now continue"
  - bugfix: "Fix chisel targets to have no range requirement (so you can use binoculars, cameras, etc.)"
  - bugfix: "Fix standard mineral blocks (uranium, diamond, plasma, etc.) not letting people use the radial menu to craft abstract statues properly.  This does not work with custom mineral blocks. (pizza, glass, etc.)"
